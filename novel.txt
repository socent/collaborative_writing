He didn't know why they were there... but they were. He didn't believe in destiny 'till this day. He had always been a realist, destiny just didn't compute. 

One fine day the man went to look for a beer, he couldn't code, he couldn't think, neither here nor there.

He didn't know why they were there...but they were. He didn't believe in destiny 'till this day. He had always been a realist, destiny just didn't compute. It was the best of times, it was the blurst of times.
